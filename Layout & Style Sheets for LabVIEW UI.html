<p>
	This LabVIEW Add On is designed to quickly stylize  a user interface using a language formatted similar to the 
	Cascading Style Sheets used to stylize webpages.  This offers some unique advantages over standard methods of 
	controlling user interface appearance in LabVIEW.  By applying styles using style sheets, a user has the ability 
	to change the background color of any user interface object using a single common name like "background-color" 
	instead of digging through the property node menus.  This same idea can be used to set the size, position, and 
	many other properties for UI objects.  This Add On provides a helpful tool as well as examples to help a user 
	get familiar with how to stylize the front panel.
</p>

<p>
	Additionally, common parts of a style sheet can be shared between applications in order to ensure the same look 
	and feel is  shared between applications.  This can be particularly helpful if multiple developers are working 
	on different software packages that will all be delivered to the same customer.  A style sheet can be defined that 
	spells out things like background color and font size, and then applied to each application using the same methods.

<h2>Using Layout & Style Sheets to customize a user interface</h2>

<p>
	Layout & Style Sheets (LSS) attempts to replicate the behavior of actual CSS code as closely as possible.  In
	order to do this, LSS works by attaching a set of "applicable selectors" to each control on the LabVIEW user
	interface.  These selectors function as the set of classes and identifiers that can be used to as references.  
	For example, a section of HTML code might look like this:<br><br>
	
	&lt;h1 id="My_Header" class="Header_style"&gt;My Header is Here!&lt;/h1&gt;<br><br>
	
	When writing CSS later, a user could reference this header using either the class name or id, or both.  Some
	CSS that could be applied to this HTML would be:<br><br>
	
	#My_Header {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: blue;<br>
	}<br><br>
	
	.Header_style {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 50px;<br>
	}<br><br>
	
	Applying these two styles would change the background color of the header text to blue, and the font size to
	50 pixels.  The '#' character is for id, and the '.' is for class.  If multiple properties exist for a specific
	item, the most specific one will be applied.  For example, adding a third item to the style sheet as follows:
	<br><br>
	
	.Header_style #My_Header {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 100px;<br>
	}<br><br>
	
	Would override the 50px font size, and replace it with a 100px font size instead.  All of these same principles
	apply with Layout & Style Sheets.  The style sheet is written in a very similar fashion, but instead of HTML, a 
	user creates a front panel using LabVIEW.  For this example, we will start with a very basic user interface that
	has a string indicator named "My_Header" to show something similar to the HTML code above.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev1.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	While this toolkit and example would work very similarly with a front panel free label, since we have chosen to 
	use a string control, we will set it's value to a default value.  At this point we can begin to use the API for 
	the LSS toolkit.  For this example we will use only two VIs.  First, place the "Obtain References" VI on the 
	block diagram.  This VI requires a reference to the VI that will be stylized using LSS.  Drop the "This VI" reference 
	and wire it into the "Obtain references" VI.  This VI acquires all front panel object references, and configures 
	the CSS like keys so we can reference our front panel objects using LSS code.  Next we will use the "Apply styles to GObjects" 
	VI.  Drop this on the diagram and wire up the "Front Panel Objects" output terminal of the "Obtain References" VI 
	to the "Front Panel Objects" input terminal on the "Apply styles to GObjects" VI.  Create a string constant off of 
	the "Style Sheet" input, this is where you will write your style sheet code.  Place the code for background-color in 
	the string constant at this point and run the application.  Instead of blue, we will make the background-color transparent. 
	Note that white space is ignored and so the LSS can be formatted to your preference.  The code should look as follows:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev2.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	After running, the front panel should look as follows.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev3.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	Note that the border did not change color.  This is because certain 
	properties in LabVIEW are not exposed to property nodes, there is no way to change the color of the border programatically. 
	To work around this problem, activate the paint brush tool then right click on the border on the front panel, click the "tab" 
	key and select Transparent for the border color.  Now the software will be able to apply any background color and the border 
	will not be visible.  Let's do this, and we will add in a few more styles to change the font size, make the label invisible, 
	and position our header.  Here is the code now and the resulting header (in run mode, so the grid doesn't show):<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev4.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev5.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	Next lets add a 2D image control to the front panel and give it the path to a picture to show as a logo image.  We will style 
	this image using LSS as well.  The LSS code here will change the image size, position, and zoom.  See the code and results:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev6.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev7.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	Our logo and header name are now ready appearance wise.	While most of this may be more convenient to do by hand, the real power 
	of LSS comes when this code must be replicated to another application, or when the appearance must be changed at run time.  For 
	this example lets say that the logo and header must change appearance when the user clicks a certain button.  To do this we will 
	simply add an event that will overwrite the LSS code we applied earlier:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev8.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev9.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	Another important feature LSS gives is the ability for properties to be shared between items.  Since both the #My_Header string 
	control and the #My_Logo picture are on the same front panel, they both share the "Pane" identifier.  By moving the "labels.visible=false" 
	property into a LSS section identified by "Pane", we can remove them from both other sections.  We also can remove all properties from the
	second set method that do not change, only new properties need to be added in each set, old properties will not be reset.  The following 
	code segment is functionally identical to the last image:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev11.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	While these features are neat, the biggest disadvantage of using LSS is that the developer must learn how to use the sudo CSS language.  In 
	order to lower the barrier to entry and allow developers to generate the LSS to stylize their application quickly the LSS toolkit comes with 
	a Live Modification Dialog VI.  This VI automatically pulls all front panel objects off of every VI in memory and lists all properties that 
	can be modified for that VI.  This VI can be run stand alone with any other application running to begin generating your custom LSS.  Run the 
	"Example After.vi" and click the "CUSTOM" button to launch the Live Modification Dialog window.  It will pull in the controls for the Example 
	application and should look as follows:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev12.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	In this image the "Unique Identifiers" section contains the full list of LSS names that can be specified in a Layout & Style Sheet.  Once clicked 
	on as has been done in this image, the "Available Properties" section populates with the full list of properties that can be customized for that 
	boolean.  Double click on the bool.false-color to add it to the diagram with default LSS formatting:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev13.jpg"></img><br><br>

	Use the color picker color box control or the RGB controls to generate a hexidecimal value for the color and replace the default black color.  For 
	convenience LSS also provides a color map.  If you would like to define all your company colors and then reference them by name instead of by their 
	hexidecimal representation add them to the color map.  In this image below we have used the color picker to change the bool.false-color for the button 
	named "Company" to a bluish-green color.  We have also changed the boolean text color to marsblue, which is in the color map as #00abc8.  Once the properties are set 
	apply the change by clicking the "Apply" button:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev14.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev15.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	In the "More Generic Identifiers" section, it can be seen that "Boolean" is a more generic identifier for this button.  This is because it falls into 
	the Boolean control class.  If we could like this style to be applied to all buttons on the front panel instead of just to the #COMPANY Button, we could change 
	the LSS as follow to get the following result:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev16.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev17.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	If we scroll down in the "Unique Identifiers" list and click on the "Boolean" identifier we can see that there are certain Identifiers that are more generic 
	as well as some that are more specific.  The "More Specific Identifiers" list has all of the buttons listed, since they are all booleans.  The "More Generic Identifiers" 
	list has things like #Upper, which is the name of the panel above the horizontal splitter bar. We can also see the "Applicable Controls" list has the same items as the 
	"More Generic Identifiers" list.  This is because the bool.false-color property will be applied to all controls that have the boolean class as an identifier.<br><br>
	
	Use the "Save" or "Load" buttons in the Live Modification Dialog to save the custom LSS as a style sheet that can be loaded from disk later or copy paste the text into a 
	string control and use as has been done in the above example.  The "Clear" button will erase the LSS in the LSS Editor.<br><br>
	
	Another benefit of LSS is the ability to apply styles to objects that are not of the same type or class.  In order to do this in CSS, each item will have a class assigned 
	to it that will give it certain properties just as was done in the CSS example above with the .Header_style class.  We have so far demonstrated how to set properties for 
	things using either their name as an identifier or their class, such as boolean.  Now we will group together items that are not of the same type.  The "Control Grouping" 
	example VI shows this the best.  On the block diagram you can see that the "grouping" input of the "Obtain References.vi" has been wired to a string constant.  This string 
	constant defines groups by adding each item to a group.  The format for adding items to the group is groupName:#controlName.  To add multiple items to the same group, simply 
	repeat the line of code for each control to be added as can be seen in this image.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev18.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	Run this example and play with the "Style Controls" on the front panel to see how changing the "background-color" property for group1 and group2 affects multiple items of 
	different LabVIEW class type in a similar manner.<br><br>
	
	To get an idea of the variety of things LSS is capable of controlling, you can also open the "Varity of Controls" example.  Here there are two VIs.  The first is named "Unstylized UI - 
	Run to Apply LSS Example.vi".  Open and run this VI according to the instructions, then run the Live Modification Dialog and configure as you wish you get a feel for LSS.  If you open 
	"Unstylized UI - After LSS has been run	.vi", you can see a simple example of the kind of properties that can be changed for each of those controls.<br><br>

	<h2>Using the Property Engine to Configure your user interface without writing value signaling events</h2>
	
	<p>
	
	Many sections of user inteface control code in LabVIEW are repetitious, such as adding an event structure to stylize certain front panel controls based on some button.  Since this 
	code is very similar, we can use a control engine to handle all this code for us with a few simple directions.  To get a feel for what this looks like, start by opening the "Property 
	Control" example.  Run this VI then modify the controls to get an idea of how the user interface changes based on the input data.  Then navigate to the block diagram and observe just 
	how little software must be written in order to make all these UI changes.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev19.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	The "Launch Control Engine.vi" on this block diagram takes care of most of the work for us.  This VI launches a property control engine asycnrhonously into the background.  Once running 
	the property control engine will watch for value change events on the controls we specify in the "Rules String" input.  This string constant here is the only code necessary to perform all the UI style control for 
	this VI.  All whitespace is ignored, so format as desired.  Note that it is also okay for control
	names to have spaces, so long as what you type in for NAME_OF_THE_CONTROL in the
	control string is an exact match of what the label name of the control is.<br><br>
	
	The format for the control string is:<br>
	IF NAME_OF_THE_CONTROL CONDITION VALUE (Multiple Conditions are supported with || or &&)<br>
	THEN LSS<br>
	ELSE LSS<br><br>

	These items are defined as follows:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>NAME_OF_THE_CONTROL - is a string that matches the label value of the conrol.</li>
	<li>CONDITION - is one of the following ==, !=, <, >, >=, <=</li>
	<li>VALUE is the value that shall be used to compare against the value of the control.  This could be a string comparison of data or numberic comparison of value.  It will also work for enums so long as the comparison for the enum is against the numeric representation 
	of the  enum.</li>
	<li>THEN is where the LSS goes that will be applied if the condition evaluates true.</li>
	<li>ELSE is where the LSS goes that will be applied if the condition evaluates false.  The else
	statement is optional.</li>
	<li>LSS is the cascading layout & style sheet that will be applied.  See one of the LSS examples
	for details on formatting of the LSS</li>
	</ul>
	<br><br>
	
	For example, if we wanted to change the LSS for all the buttons whenever a control named "SetpointA" goes above 3 and "SetpointB" is below 4, we would write the following:<br>
	
	IF SetpointA > 3 && SetpointB is < 4<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEN Boolean {bool.false-color:#ffffff;}<br><br>
	
	Take note that the no () were used in the IF statement, they could have been, and the engine would interpret this just the same.  For example, the following is equivelent to the code above.<br>
	
	IF ((SetpointA > 3) && (SetpointB is < 4))<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEN Boolean {bool.false-color:#ffffff;}<br><br>
	
	</p>
</p>

	<h2>Adding to the existing framework</h2>
	
	<p>
	There are hundreds of property nodes in LabVIEW, and as such not all of them have been implemented in this framework.  It is, however, very easy to add more properties to the framework if there are some in particular
	that you need for your task.  This section will walk through how to add properties to the framework.<br><br>
	
	The first thing to do is open the VI named "Apply styles to GObjects.vi" as seen below.  There are two outer for loops that iterate through the various properties passed to this VI which performs the modification.  Do 
	not modify either of these outer for loops.  On the inside of the second for loop you will see that an unbundle is providing a "Property" and a "Value" string (cirled in this image).<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev20.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	These two values are given to a set of case structures.  To decide at which level to place the new property, first decide wether the property can be applied to many different objects, or wether it will only apply to a 
	specific type of object such as a graph.  If it can be applied to many objects (such as the "position" property), then add it to the first case structure. Since "position" is a property all GObjects share, it resides in 
	the top case structure, the reference is cast as a GObject and the position is set:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev21.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	To add a more specific property, leave the outer case structure at default and then navigate in the inner case structure to the class of the object you are modifying.  For example, to add the zoom property to a Picture 
	class control, navigate to the Picture class and add the zoom property as seen here.  You can also add new object classes if the one you are searching for is not in the case structure.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev22.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	In order to get your new class to work with the "Live Modification Dialog", two more VIs must be modified.  First, open "Find Properties that apply to Object.vi" and add the new property into the inner most case structre 
	seen here if adding a new control.  For example, if adding a property to the "Digital" class, you would add it to the the list here if it can also be applied to the "Enum", "Ring", and "String" classes.  If it cannot, you 
	will need to modify how this VI works to pass out the additional property for only that class.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev23.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	If the item you are adding is not a control class object, you will need to add it a level up from here, such as how the properties for the "Decoration" class have been added here:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev24.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	The last VI that must be modified is the "Generate Default LSS.vi".  This VI only needs to be modified if the property you are adding will not have the same default value as an already existing property.  This VI defines 
	what is places into the LSS Editor when the property is double clicked in the "Live Modification Dialog" window.  For example, background-color will place the following LSS into the Editor.<br><br>
	
	#selectedControl{ <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color:#000000;<br>
	}<br><br>
	
	To add a new one such as a default value of 0.5 for the zoom property added for the picture class, add it as follows to the case structure:<br><br>
	
	<img src="images\rev25.jpg"></img><br><br>
	
	</p>
